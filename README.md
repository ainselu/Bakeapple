This repository is a virtual machine for my programming language, Bakeapple.
The compiler will be written some other time, too complex and not enough energy right now, but this will suffice for now.
Apologies if my code isn't the best, I'm kind of new to C++, and I've only been coding in it since Oct. 2024. 

Deps: CLI11
